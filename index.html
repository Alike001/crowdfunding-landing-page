      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <div class="grid">
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>1. Create Campaign</h3>
        <p>Campaign owners set a funding goal, title, and description. The campaign details are stored in a smart contract on the blockchain with a campaign id.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card"> 
        <h3>2. Fund with ETH</h3>
        <p>Supporters contribute ETH directly to the campaign contract using the campaign id before funding. Every contribution is transparent and traceable on-chain.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>3. Withdraw</h3>
        <p>If the funding goal is reached, the campaign owner can withdraw the funds using their campaign id.</p>
